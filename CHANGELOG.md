#### Version 2.0.0 (2022.12.02)

This version has changed a lot of things, most of them are **BREAKING CHANGE**s!

- **Dropped support for Python versions older than 3.7.**
- **Redesigned the command line interface.**
  - `pigar generate` to generate requirements.txt.
  - `pigar search` to search packages/distributions by the top level module names.
  - `pigar check` to check the latest versions of requirements.
  - `pigar -h` to explore more.
  - `pigar` accepts a prefix for a command, such as `pigar gen`, `pigar c`.
- **Refactored a lot of code and interfaces.**
- [Vendoring](https://github.com/pradyunsg/vendoring) the [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to access more sophisticated utilities(`pip` named it's module as `_internal` so vendoring technology is introduced).
  - Fixed a lot of issues when parsing the requirements file, e.g. [#113](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/113).
  - Fixed the issues for editable requirements, e.g. [#60](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/60).
- Tweaked some default actions and introduced more options for better user experience.
  - `pigar` will ask user to choose the right packages/distributions if `pigar` has found multiple packages/distributions for the same module names. With `--auto-select` enabled, `pigar` will guess the best matched one or choose all possible packages/distributions automatically.
  - Added an option `--dry-run` which allows `pigar` to not write a requirements.txt file, just print it.
  - Added an option `--follow-symbolic-links/--dont-follow-symbolic-links` to let user decide whether to follow the symbolic links, fixed [#89](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/89).
  - Added an option `-i/--index-url` to allow the custom URL of the Python Package Index, fixed [#52](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/52).
  - Removed the spaces from requirements specifier, fixed [#86](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/86).
  - Added an option `--show-differences/--dont-show-differences` to enable or disable showing the differences when the requirements file is overwritten.
- Introduced `asyncio` to synchronize distributions' metadata with the PyPI, the process is much faster now.
- Refactored the code to make the index database more reliable.
  - Add unique contstraints to avoid duplicate records, fixed [#119](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/119).
  - Store versions in the database to do incremental index synchronization.


#### Version 1.0.2 (2022.11.12)

- Parse requirements file with the more sophisticated utility, fixed [#48](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/48), [#113](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/113). See [#115](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/pull/115) for details.
- Fixed [#99](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/issues/99), continue if a local package isn't exists. See [#107](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/pull/107) for details.
- Fixed too many values to unpack error when parsing git config. See [#97](https://github.com/damnever/pigar/pull/97) for details.


#### Version 1.0.0 (2022.06.22)

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Disable the comments which contain filenames and line numbers by default, use `--with-referenced-comments` to enable this feature.

#### Version 0.10.0 (2020.03.14)

- Refactored the main logic, **the interface has been changed**, be careful if you are using `pigar` as a library.
